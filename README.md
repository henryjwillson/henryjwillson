# About my Github
All repositories presented have been put together soley for Bean Drop Ltd; due to commercial sensitivity, a number of repositories have had sections removed. The hidden sections are noted in each repository, and in their absence, video footage of working segments has been provided. I am happy to discuss the architecture of these hidden sections with recruiters.
